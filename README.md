# Fake-News-Detection-

## Overview
The *Fake News Detection* project is designed to identify and classify news articles as real or fake using machine learning techniques. This project leverages natural language processing (NLP) to analyze textual content and determine its authenticity.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning.
- Implementation of NLP techniques such as tokenization and vectorization.
- Use of machine learning algorithms for classification.
- Evaluation of model performance using metrics like accuracy and confusion matrix.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6+
- Libraries:
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - sklearn
  - nltk
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn

## Installation
1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Install the required dependencies using pip:
   bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   

## Usage
1. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   bash
   jupyter notebook fake_news_detection.ipynb
   
2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to load the dataset, preprocess the data, and train the model.
3. Evaluate the model's performance and test it with custom inputs.

## Files
- *fake_news_detection.ipynb*: The main notebook containing code for the Fake News Detection project.
- *requirements.txt*: Contains the list of required libraries and their versions.
- *data/*: Folder containing the dataset for training and testing.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains labeled news articles categorized as real or fake. Ensure the dataset is placed in the data/ directory before running the notebook.

## Example Workflow
1. Load the dataset.
2. Perform data cleaning and preprocessing.
3. Apply vectorization techniques such as TF-IDF.
4. Train machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Gradient Forest Classifier.
5. Evaluate the model's accuracy and adjust hyperparameters for optimization.
